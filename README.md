# The definitive FNA+Nez Template
This is an updated reimplementation that *actually works* based on the 
fork of [FNA-VSCode-Template (For Nez)](https://github.com/prime31/FNA-VSCode-Template/) for having a quick setup with FNA and NEZ.
## Features
* Got rid of MonoGame Content pipeline. 
* All other good features from [FNA-VSCode-Template](https://github.com/prime31/FNA-VSCode-Template/)

## Using
* See [the Prerequisites from FNA-VSCode-Template](https://github.com/prime31/FNA-VSCode-Template/#prerequisites) 

 * Run the following command inside your project folder. Must be empty (Without any file or repo, the script makes a `git init`). 
  ```bash
git https://github.com/wolfarmoon/NezTemplate/ . && ./CreateProject.sh
```
  > **Note**:  if you are using Windows, use the `CreateProject.ps1` instead. (Not tested in Windows yet)
# Acknowledgements
Thanks to **optimo** for the vscode tasks and launch for linux also for all the help that he gave me.
