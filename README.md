# The definitive FNA+Nez Template
This is an updated reimplementation that *actually works* based on the 
fork of [FNA-VSCode-Template (For Nez)](https://github.com/prime31/FNA-VSCode-Template/) for having a quick setup with FNA and NEZ.
## Features
* Got rid of MonoGame Content pipeline. (If you want it go to the MonoGame Content Pipeline section below.)
* All other good features from [FNA-VSCode-Template](https://github.com/prime31/FNA-VSCode-Template/)
---
## Using
> See [the Prerequisites from FNA-VSCode-Template](https://github.com/prime31/FNA-VSCode-Template/#prerequisites)
